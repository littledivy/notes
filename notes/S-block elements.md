# S-block elements

(1) Alkali metals 
  Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr*

  * radioactive, not studying atm.
  
  => Size - top to bottom increases
  => Ionic size - top to bottom increases
  => Electronegativity - top to bottom decreases.
  => Reactivity - top to bottom decreases.
  => Density 
     d = mass / volume

### Density order

  L < K < Na < Rb < Cs
  
### Hydration enthalpy
  
  - Size is aqueous medium
  - Order of electrical resistance

  Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs

  - Minimum electrical conductivity
  - Ionic mobility (speed of movement)

  Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs

H.E. ∝ 1/size      

===

> Alkali metals are strong reducing agents.

> CS has low melting point.

> Na has more ionisation potential compared to K.

### Reaction with active hydrogen compounds

* Active hydrogens
  
  Those 'H' atoms that react with alkali metals to give salt & H2 gas.
  
  ```
  Na + EtOH --> EtO(-)Na(+) + H2
       ^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^
                   salt
      active hydrogen
  ```

  Active H-containing compounds - 
  1) H of acids. eg, HCl, HBr.
  2) H attached with O, N & terminal alkynes.
 
> Terminal alkynes - Hydrogen attached in the end.
    R - C ≡ C - H 

### Reaction with H2 Gas

Alkali metals can directly react with H2 gas to form metal hydrides.

2M + H2 --> 2M(+)H(-)

H feels humiliated with the minus charge and therefore tries to give it away, making metal hydrides unstable and powerful reducing agents.

#### Binary ionic compunds

Compounds with 2 molecules whose stability ∝ latice entalpy ∝ IE ∝ charge ∝ 1/size

LH > NaH > KH > RbH > CsH (order of stability)

### Reducing nature in aq. medium.

(will be convered in 12th grade - Electrochemical series)

In aq. medium, the strongest reducing agent is Li. 

Standard Oxidiation potential of Li is the highest.
```
E^o Li/Li(+)(aq) = +305V 
```

Standard oxidation potential - tendency to get oxidised.

### Carbonates of alkali metals

Carbonates of alkali metals are stable and they do not get decomposed on heating, except Li (cuz why not).

Eg: 
Na2CO3(s) --heat--> no rxn
K2CO3(s) --heat--> no rxn

but, Li2CO3(s) --heat--> Li2O(s) + CO2 

### Bicarbonates of alkali metals

(eg LiHCO3, NaHCO3, KHCO3, ...)

1) Bicarbonates of first group are white solids, except LiHCO3 (bruh).

2) LiHCO3 exists only in aq. medium. Therefore, LiHCO3(s) does not exist (lol).

3) 2NaHCO3 (s) --heat--> Na2CO3(s) + CO2 + H20
   (T > 100deg C)

4) In NaHCO3, polymeric chain of HCO3- ion is found. Whereas, in KHCO3, dimer of HCO3- ion is found. Both of these are formed due to hydrogen bonding.

Due to polymeric chain of HCO3- ions, NaHCO3 is less soluble than KCHO3

### Amalgam formation

Alkali metals get dissolved in mercury with release of energy to form amalgam.

Na (solute) + Hg (solvent) --> Na-Hg (sodium amalgam) + heat

### Nitrates of alkali metals

Nitrates of alkali metals on general heating gives metal nitrites and O2 gas.

Li ion behaves as group 2 nitrates and it gives oxide NO2 and O2 gas.
 LiNO3(s) --heat--> Li2O + NO2 + O2

(also shown by group 2, D block & P block metal nitrates)

> NO2 gas is reddish brown in colour, like Br2.

### Reaction with liquid ammonia (NH3)

1) At normal temperature, NH3 exists in gaseous state.

2) Reaction is carried out at around -150deg C where ammonia is in liquid state.

3) ```
   Na(s) + (x + y) NH3(l) --> [Na(NH3)x](+) + [e- (NH3)y]
                               ^^^^^^^^        ^^^^^^^^ ammoniated electron
                            ammoniated sodium ion 
   ```
   at -50deg C

4) This solution is blue colored, it is conducting in nature because of ammoniated e- and its nature.

5) It has conductance similar to typical metals (Fe, Cu, etc).

6) It is paramagenetic (presence of unpaired electron) in nature.

7) It has lower density than liquid NH3 itself.
   i.e. d (soultion) < d (solvent)

8) If concentrated solution of these alkali metals in liquid ammonia taken then, its colour changes to bronze and it becomes _diamagnetic in nature_ because ammoniated electrons get paired up.

### Chemical properties of NaOH

1) Reaction with acids

```
NaOH + HCl --> NaCl + H2O

NaOH + H3PO4 --> NaH2PO4 + H2O
       ^^^^^
       weak polytropic acid

NaOH + Na2HPO4 --> NA3PO4 + H2O
```
