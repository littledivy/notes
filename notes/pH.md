# pH

pH is unitless quantity, which indicates relative acidity or basicity. 

pH = - log[H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] = - log[H<sup>+</sup>]


## pH of water

[H+] = [OH-]

-log[H+] = -log[OH-]

pH = pOH

[H+][OH-] = Kw

-log[H+]-log[OH-] = -log(Kw)

pH = pOH = PKw / 2

at 25C, PKw = 14

Therefore, pH = 14 / 2 = 7
