# Fluid

## Pressure 

Cause by accelaration due to gravity & accelaration of fluid.

```
P = (dF)_inward / Area
```

**BUT NO**

## Cause and Reason

The above theory has a little issue, we're writing pressure in terms of force but in certain cases, pressure creates force.

```
(dF)_inward = Pressure * Area
```

The fluid has pressure when no force is applied on it. What we experience is on the surface is force, i.e. perpendicular inward.

> Honestly, this is kinda dumb. It techinally is still written in terms of force, just rearranged the equation. 


## Atmospheric pressure -

Due to _weight of atmosphere_. Device: Barometer.
```python
P (Hg) = 13.6 x 10^3 # Kg/m
H (Hg) = 76 # cm
g = 9.81 # m/s^2

P (atm) = P (Hg) * g * H (Hg)
P (atm) = 1.0132 x 10^5 # N/m^2
# Therefore, air applies 1.0132 x 10^5 N force on an horizontal surface (perpendicularly inward)
```

## Variation in P

1) Pressure increases with depth linearly, _when density is independent of depth and it is constant._

## Manometric principle

Difference in pressure at two different elevations is directly proportional to the difference in elevations.

### Example based on manometric principle

U-tube

```
           |-|  |-| <-- Spirit 
 Water --> |-|  |-|
         A |_|  |_| B
           \-\__/-/ <-- Hg
```

P<sub>A</sub> = P<sub>B</sub>

P<sub>w</sub> H<sub>w</sub> = P<sub>s</sub> H<sub>s</sub>
