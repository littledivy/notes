# Ionic equilibriums

Equilibrium reactions involving ions.

1) Electrolyte :-
   Conducts electricity due to presence of ions.
   Eg: Nacl in Water
  
2) Non-electrolyte :-
   Does not conduct electricity.
   Glocose, Surcrose, Urea, etc.

## Electrolyte

- Acid 
   - Strong acid ( Mineral acids )
    Eg: HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc.

  - Weak acid ( Organic acids )
    Eg: H2CO3, CH3COOH, etc.
- Base 
  - Strong base (Hydroxides of Group 1 & 2, 100% dissociation)
    Eg: KOH, Ba(OH)2, etc.

  - Weak base
    Eg: Zn(OH)2, AgOH, NH4OH, etc.

- Salt (strong electrolyte)
  
  Examples of salf formation :-

* Dissociation of Strong electrolyte => Irreversible 

* Dissociation of Weak electrolyte => Reversible (equilibrium)
